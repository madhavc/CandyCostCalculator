CandyCostCalculator
===================

C++ program that reads in the unit price for a pack of candy, as well as how many packs you want to buy. The program will output the subtotal cost, tax charged (tax rate 8.5%), and the total cost.
For example, the input/output dialog may appear as:

	What is the price for a pack of candy? (in dollars)
	1.5 
	How many packs you’d buy?
	7
	Here’s your cost.
	Subtotal:	 	$10.50
	Tax:			$0.89
	Total:			$11.39
